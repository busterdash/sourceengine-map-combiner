# Source-Map Combiner

Project in its current state can generate a valid Valve Map Format file from a genuine VMF file created with the Hammer World Editor program.

Testing still needs to be done to determine if this project can import multiple files and combine them into one that works in the world editor.

At this time, file output is displayed on the screen as text on a webpage; expect that to change shortly.
